subtitle: What is the best O(n) Hessian query?

# Abstract
abstract: |
    Ill conditioned loss landscapes are ubiquitous in machine learning, and they slow down optimization. Preconditioning the gradient to make the loss more isotropic is a natural solution, but is challenging for extremely large problems, as direct access to the problem Hessian is prohibitively expensive. We present two fresh approaches to preconditioning using tools from randomized numerical linear algebra and online convex optimization for efficient access to Hessian information, motivated by the question: what is the most useful information we can query from the problem Hessian using O(n) memory and compute?
